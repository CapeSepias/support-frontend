        ... we’d like to explain why we need your support. Advertising revenues
        across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations,
        we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open
        as we can. The Guardian&#39;s independent, investigative journalism takes
        a lot of time, money and hard work to produce.
      </p>
      <p className="contributions-context__copy">
        If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it,
        our future would be much more secure.
      </p>
      <h1 className="contributions-context__subheading">support the Guardian&#39;s</h1>
